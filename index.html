                                    <br>

                I built this little website with the intent of having a resume that is a bit more extensive than what would typically be found on a single page. 
                Everything from my professional and academic history can be found here. I am an outgoing individual who picks up skills quickly, enjoys interacting with individuals, 
                and strives to be better than he was the day before. I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of South Carolina in 2021. Feel free to look around and get in touch with me if you have questions.

                                Developed strong troubleshooting and technical skills when it came to device repair. This included data retrieval, hardware replacements and repair, malware removal, and hardware upgrades. I worked on everything that had a power button and would fit through the front door of the shop. Due to this, I was exposed to a very wide variety of devices and feel very comfortable working with them. Strong customer service skills where mandatory and being able to explain complex technical topics in a way that the average person could understand was also a must. I also worked with a ticketing system to ensure everything was being documented and the customer kept up-to-date.

                                I have known Inan for 7 years and am his former manager. He is punctual, a fast learner, and a team player. In the time that he worked for me I also found him to be a self-motivated, reliable, and hard worker. On days I was short staffed, it was often very hard to find someone who would come in and give me a hand, but Inan could always be relied on to step up and help me out if I called. There were also many times when floor sets kept us at the store late into the night, and Inan helped keep the team motivated to complete the tasks at hand.

                                Inan is a very charismatic person. In a group setting he always stands out and brightens the mood. He is also extremely reliable. Inan has always helped me when I have needed it, even without me asking him to. When I shared with him that I was looking for a new computer for video editing, he offered to help me find exactly what I needed. He explained to me what specs I would need on my computer to complete my tasks. He then looked online and found me an affordable computer with all the specs that I needed. Not only that, but he also set up my computer, 4 monitors, installed all the programs I needed, and organized my cables.

                                Inan and I were in the College of Computing together at USC-Columbia. Throughout our time in undergrad, he never failed to impress me with his genius in computing and his very charismatic way of explaining technical topics. We have worked on numerous projects together and each time he was able to be efficient and articulate in his work - and it showed in the result. Inan can bring not only the technical card to the table, but a mind that will be able to form and maintain relationships with clients.
